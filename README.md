# CMDB-P2
- This repo will serve to implement the Web user interface to the CMDB application developed in part 1 and 2. The server provides data access support for internal memory and for the elastic search database.
The main goal here is to build our first website while incorporating new technologies and techniques covered in lectures.

## Run server: 
- nodemon cmdb-launch.mjs -e mjs, hbs

## Run tests:
- npm test tests/unit
- npm test tests/integration
